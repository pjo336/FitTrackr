1. Install virtual environment
sudo pip install virtualenv

2. Create virtual environment inside package being worked on
$ mkdir myproject
$ cd myproject
$ virtualenv venv
New python executable in venv/bin/python
Installing distribute............done.



3. Now, whenever you want to work on a project, you only have to activate the corresponding environment. On OS X and Linux, do the following:

$ . venv/bin/activate


4. Install packages needed while venv is active
pip install Flask
pip install flask-bootstrap
pip install flask-login
pip install pymongo

(Note, all this stuff installed is only installed in the venv, therefore when it is not active in your current terminal window, it will seem like its not installed)


5. When done, deactivate the venv
$ deactivate
